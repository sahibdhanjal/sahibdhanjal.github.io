            As a part of the <a href="https://dasc-lab.github.io/">DASC Lab</a>, over the course of 1.5 years, I
            implemented and scaled multiple optimization-based control and coverage algorithms developed by <a
              href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e4efxWQAAAAJ&hl=en">Will</a> and
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ny1yTusAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Dimitra Panagou</a>,
            translating theoretical guarantees into a deployable and simulation-validated system. <a
              href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/strg/ecf2016/AstroNet.html">AstroNet</a> was one such
            research initiative focused on enabling autonomous coverage and discrete navigation strategies for NASA’s
            free-flying <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/astrobee">Astrobee</a> robots operating aboard the ISS, with the
            goal of reducing reliance on human teleoperation.

          <p>
            As can be seen in the embedded video, in this project I primarily focused on building a high-fidelity ISS
            simulation environment using <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/">ROS</a> and <a
              href="https://gazebosim.org/home">Gazebo</a> to evaluate coverage strategies under realistic microgravity
            dynamics and sensing constraints. This included developing an optimized real-time control pipeline capable
            of executing discrete coverage policies within the ROS ecosystem while maintaining stable closed-loop
            behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            To support end-to-end evaluation, I designed a distributed architecture integrating MATLAB (core control and
            coverage algorithms), ROS (middleware), Gazebo (physics simulation), and an immersive VR visualization
            interface via an <a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift/">Oculus Rift</a>. This framework enabled closed-loop
            validation of guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) strategies prior to hardware deployment, significantly
            improving experimental throughput and reproducibility.

            reconnaissance missions using multiple robots. The goal was to get a swarm of heterogeneous robots to work
            together seamlessly—even in unpredictable environments—while avoiding collisions and keeping track of their
            positions.

            My main focus was on multi-robot localization and collision avoidance, helping the drones and rovers
            navigate in sync without stepping on each other’s toes. I was also solely responsible for the system
            architecture as well, where I developed a pub-sub architecture using ROS for this swarm of robots to
            communicate with each other.The project gave me hands-on experience with distributed algorithms, sensor
            fusion, and resilient swarm coordination. As you can see from the videos attached, we were trying to make
            the robots follow generic routines such as following a set path or creating a defined shape while the
            control algorithms were running in real-time. From the embedded videos, you can see how a set of 4 drones,
            as well as 3 rovers were able to create basic shapes without colliding or running into each other. For the
            purposes of the shown experiments, localization was done using simple vicon motion-capture systems in indoor
            environments but using SLAM outdoors using the sensors (lidar + odometry) the rovers were equipped with.

            This project was more attuned to be a masters theses than anything. From the time I learned about SLAM, I
            wanted to see if robots/devices can locate inside indoor environments using signals from low cost sensors
            such as WiFi/BLE Beacons which are already installed in most buildings. Working under <a
              href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l2jdSb8AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Maani Ghaffari</a>, I was working
            on exploring how radio waves, specifically WiFi can be used to accurately locate the 3DOF position of a
            device inside a GPS denied environment. After much exploration, I was able to create a deep neural network
            which was able to differentiate between Line-Of-Sight/Non-Line-Of-Sight packets with an accuracy of ~95%.
            Without this classifier, the robot often lost track of its position in the environment as seen in the
            illustration below (FastSLAM without classifier).

          <p>
            The algorithm was initially developed and tested using the open-source <a
              href="https://pylayers.github.io/pylayers/">PyLayers</a> simulator. On confirmation that our core
            algorithm worked, we proceeded to test it out on the <a href="https://fetchrobotics.com/">Fetch</a> robot,
            using the Friis Free Space model and our classifier to act as a measurment in Fast SLAM, while using the
            robot's wheel odometry as its positioning model. A variant using particle filter based SLAM was also
            implemented to evaluate performance. In our experiments, we were able to achieve a remarkably
            accurate localization with a ~1.6m RMSE in 35m x 170m indoor environment. We can see how the FastSLAM
            performs when the classifier is used to inform its state in the animation below.

            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ny1yTusAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Dimitra Panagou</a> where we were
            using an AR glass, as well as a camera to provide the robot with assistive camera views. The vicon
            motion capture system was also used to track ground-truth head motions, which was then used to fit a
            Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to define the visual interest function of the user using online Expectation
            Maximization (EM). My role on this project was solely enablement - I was responsible for setting up the
            entire software stack for the project, including the AR glasses, the camera, and the vicon system as well as
            implementing the algorithm in C++ as well as optimizing the hell out of it using CUDA.

            You can see in the embedded video how the drone is autonomously able to navigate to the task which is of
            highest importance, but not being currently focused on by the operator. The core goal of this project was
            that lets say an operator has multiple tasks to do - task 1, task 2, task 3 (ordered by priority), if the
            operator is focusing on task 2 at the moment, the drone automatically navigates to task 1 while providing a
            visual feed on how that is unfolding. For in-depth details on this project, I'd highly encourage you to
            refer to the paper we published with are findings in it.

            Another one of those fun projects from the <a href="https://rob550-docs.github.io/">UMich Curriculum</a>,
            in this project, a team of 2 people was responsible for building a self-balancing two-wheeled bot from
            scratch. We had to design everything from scratch — all the way from mechanical design, to the cascaded PID
            controller. The goal of the project was to autonomously navigate obstacle courses while maintaining its
            balance and positioning.

          <p>
            We used a combination of wheel odometry and Vicon based motion capture to estimate the bot's current
            position and orientation. Control algorithms were developed to control the bot's balance, motion and
            orientation, as well as dictating what it needs to do. The bot was able to navigate obstacle courses while
            maintaining its balance and positioning, that too within very strict time limits. In a competition of 12
            teams, ours was the fastest and most stable!

            high-quality pose labels from raw images, eliminating the need for manual annotation. These labeled poses
            were used to train PoseNet as a visual sensor model, while GPS and odometry data provided the action model
            for the robot. The approach integrated learning-based perception with probabilistic state estimation in a
            factor graph using <a href="https://borg.cc.gatech.edu/">GTSAM</a> and <a
              href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/isam/">iSAM</a>.

            served as the learned observation model, regressing camera poses from images, which were fused with
            motion priors from odometry and GPS in real time. The system was first validated in GTSAM simulations to
            ensure consistency and robustness before deployment on a differential drive mobile robot. In real-world
            operation, camera inputs were processed online, and PoseNet outputs were integrated with motion data to
            provide continuously refined pose estimates.
          </p>
          <p>By combining deep learning with classical state estimation, this framework offered a scalable, hybrid
            approach for robust localization. It demonstrated that automatically labeled camera data could train
            effective sensor models, while probabilistic factor-graph optimization ensured globally consistent pose
            estimation for mobile robotic systems.

            A more trivial project (compared to the previous ones ofcourse), this one was a part of our curriculum at
            UMich as well. We were given the GTA 10k dataset and were supposed to develop a custom neural network to
            regress the 3D bounding box of vehicles in the dataset using a simplistic bounding box detector and
            geometric constraints. As a solution, I developed a simplistic 20-layer SE-ResNet + YOLO 3D bounding box
            regression incorporating ideas from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00496">Mousavian et al.</a>. It was

            Pedestrian tracking is a long standing problem and multiple ways of tracking them accurately have already
            been developed. The problem comes in when pedestrians are occluded or when there are multiple pedestrians
            in the scene. In this project, I developed a pedestrian detection and tracking system that combines
            deep learning–based instance segmentation with probabilistic multi-target tracking using a particle filter.
            A pre-trained <a href="https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN">Mask R-CNN</a> was modified to only capture
            and segment pedestrians at the pixel level allowing for precise localization even in partially occluded or
            crowded scenes.

            reliable multi-target tracking without requiring explicit data association for every object, while optical
            flow captured short-term motion dynamics between consecutive frames. By fusing motion information with
            segmentation outputs, the system was able to estimate and update the trajectories of multiple pedestrians
            simultaneously, even when they crossed paths or experienced temporary occlusion. The pipeline was evaluated

            focused on designing fully autonomous maritime systems capable of navigating complex marine environments
            without human intervention. For this project, I developed a robust software and perception stack to support
            high-fidelity autonomy on an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). I architected and implemented a scalable
            sensor-fusion framework that tightly integrates a spatial dual GPS/IMU module with high-resolution imaging

            improving the vehicle’s ability to localize and interact with its environment. I also developed advanced
            calibration pipelines for LiDAR–LiDAR and camera–LiDAR extrinsic alignment using PnP and 3D correspondences,
            based on established multi-sensor calibration techniques, which significantly enhanced the coherence of
            multi-modal data streams for perception and planning. Finally, I deployed a SLAM framework in ROS leveraging
            gmapping, costmap_2d, and AMCL libraries, enabling reliable mapping, localization, and autonomous waypoint
            navigation within the competition arena and demonstrating an end-to-end autonomy solution capable of

            Another one of my undergrad projects, where I worked on designing and developing a gesture controlled
            robotic arm under the guidance of <a
              href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=rwWOPY8AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr.
              R.K.Mittal</a>. I used two MPU 6050s, fixed on a glove to estimate the motion of the user's hand. This
            was coupled with XBees and an Arduino UNO for wireless commnuication with the main laptop, which basically
            enabled the robotic arm to mimic the users hand gestures. The robotic arm was large enough to completely
            span a 2ft hemispherical workspace, with a 500g payload.

            This was my very first introduction to robotics so it really is close to my heart. In this summer
            internship, I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gW4Q_7UAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. D.K.
              Pratihar</a> from IIT Kharagpur, designing and developing a portable whiteboard cleaner (RR:PR
            manipulator) for white/black boards up to 4'×6'. I worked on chip design, fabrication as well as programming
            the servo motors to automatically clean the entire board. I also presented a whitepaper of this work
            at <a href="https://upcon15.iiita.ac.in/">IEEE UPCON'15</a>.

          <p>Hey! 👋</p>
          <p>I’m <strong>Sahib Dhanjal</strong>, a robotics engineer obsessed with building machines that can
            think, move, and navigate the world on their own. I spend my days (and many late nights) tinkering with
            hardware, experimenting with algorithms, and pushing robots to better understand and interact with their
            surroundings.</p>
          <p>Outside work, you’ll find me playing soccer, ultimate frisbee, or volleyball — maybe even running 🏃,
            hiking 🏔️, and biking 🚴🏻.</p>
